 * Problem 235: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * 
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) 
 * of two given nodes in the BST.
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common 
 * ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T 
 * that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a 
 * descendant of itself).”
 * 
 * Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
 * 
 *           6
 *          / \
 *        2     8
 *       / \   / \
 *      0  4  7   9
 *        / \
 *       3   5
 * Example 1:
 *      Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
 *      Output: 6
 *      Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *      Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
 *      Output: 2
 *      Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a 
 * 					 descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 * 
 * Note:
 *     All of the nodes' values will be unique.
 *     p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
